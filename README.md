# How to install on your server
## You will need to use the "infid" version of MCGalaxy.
You may download it from the bottom of the page [here](https://www.classicube.net/mcg/download/), by clicking the small italic text.

**Optional:** If you don't want to start with a completely fresh server, you may copy `MCGalaxy.exe` and `MCGalaxy_.dll` from the infid download and paste them into your existing server files, replacing the old ones. The server must be *off* while you do this.

## After you have the "infid" version of MCGalaxy:
1. Shut down your server if it is running.
2. Copy the files inside of `blockdefs` into your server's blockdefs folder.
3. Copy the files inside of `blockprops` into your server's blockprops folder. If this folder doesn't exist, just create it.
4. Start up your server.
5. Use `/texture global https://garbage.loan/f/Goodly/customopenblocks.zip`
6. Or `/texture global https://garbage.loan/f/Goodly/customopenblocksvanilla.zip`

That's it!
