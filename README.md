## How to install on your server
You need [inf-id](https://github.com/UnknownShadow200/MCGalaxy/tree/master/Uploads) version of MCGalaxy, otherwise not all blocks will be useable.

This will replace any existing global blocks you may have already had, so it is best to use on a new server.

1. Shut down your server and install inf-id MCGalaxy_.dll if you do not already have it. This will enable blocks past ID 255 to work.
2. Copy the contents of `blockdefs` into your server's blockdefs folder.
3. Copy the contents of `blockprops` into your server's blockprops folder. If this folder doesn't exist, just create it.
4. Start up your server.
5. Use `/texture global https://garbage.loan/f/Goodly/customopenblocks.zip`
6. Or `/texture global https://garbage.loan/f/Goodly/customopenblocksvanilla.zip`

That's it!
